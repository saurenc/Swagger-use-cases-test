Aim is to the test the swagger petstore by designing few automated test cases using Rest assured library and TestNG as the framework
API - https://petstore.swagger.io/#/pet

The below tests are created to demonstrate 
1. Create a new pet using POST method and verifying if the created pet is in line with the supplied details
2. Retrieve the pet details using petID through GET method
3. Update the pet name using POST method
4. Delete the pet details using DELETE method


The user has to execute the test cases by running te TestNG file(test cases has been prioritised accordingly)
Tests can be configured to be executed at class level or individual tests level
Configuration & property files are attached in the project for reference and can be changed accordingly - TESTNG_Config.jpg

Have also added the POSTMAN collection tests are added under the project(incase of manual intervention)
